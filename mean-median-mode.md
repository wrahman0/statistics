# Means/Median/Mode
#financial analysis#

* These are just different ways to describe a set of numbers
* The meaning is based on situation
* Point estimate can lose data

**Median:**
* Not affected by extreme values

**Mode:**
* More useful for bucketed data

**Geometric Mean:**
* `G = \sqrt{n}(x_1*x_2*...*x_n)`
* Or `G = \frac{sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln{X_i}}{n}`
* Used for multiplicative returns
* Essentially what you have to multiply by for all the return periods to see the difference between first and last

**Harmonic Mean:**
* Take the sum of reciprocals
* then take the reciprocal and multiply by n
* Useful for dealing with ratios
